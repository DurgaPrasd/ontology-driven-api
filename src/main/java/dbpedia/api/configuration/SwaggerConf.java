        + "using mappings between Wikipedia infoboxes and the DBpedia Ontology to become accessible "
        + "for complex requests. \n"
        + "\n"
        + "This API provides a REST-conform interface. The API uses the DBpedia Ontology and "
        + "transforms HTTP requests into SPARQL queries, which are then sent to the DBpedia "
        + "endpoint (https://dbpedia.org/sparql). The results can be returned in a range of formats, "
        + "such as JSON, JSON-LD, TSV, and different styles (that means more or less human readable,"
        + " e.g. nested JSON).\n\n"

        + "There are three requests types: "
        + "<br><b> Value</b><br> Say you're interested in the properties of an entity that is represented "
        + "as a DBpedia resource: you can query either all the properties that are stored in the "
        + "DBpedia for this entity or you can ask for a specific property that you have in mind "
        + "(and that exists in the DBpedia). "
        + "In any case you will get the values of the properties (that is, the object in RDF terms). "
        + "A value can be either a literal (e.g. a number) or another entity. For example, you"
        + " can just give the entity 'Barack_Obama' and will get all the properties, or, "
        + "additionally to 'Barack_Obama', you ask for the property 'gender' and will get the value 'male'. "
        + "<br> <b>Entity</b><br> Similar to the values request, but the other way around: here, you're "
        + "interested in all the entities, that share the value of the property that you have at hand. "
        + "For example you ask for all the events, where Barack_Obama was 'nominee'."
        + "<br> <b>Instance</b><br> Here, you're interested in the instances of an ontology class,"
        + " e.g. 'Actor' or 'Company'. You can filter those instances by certain criteria. For example, "
        + "you can ask for all the instances of the class 'Company' that have more than 48000 employees. <br>"
        + "<br>"

        + "We also provide different output and prettyfication options:<br><br>"

        + "-PREFIXED replaces the DBpediaUris of the objects with their prefixes<br>"
        + "-NESTED every entity has its own JSON-Object with all the related properties. Only works with JSON.<br> "
